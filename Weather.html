Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be
displayed in a web browser. It 
can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into 
multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally 
included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other 
objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means 
to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, 
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
written using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. 
Other tags such as surround and provide information about document text and may include 
other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret 
the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the 
behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and 
current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS 
over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2]

-Also that city is added to the search history

-WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city I see:

---the date
---an icon representing weather conditions
---the temperature
---the humidity
---the wind speed
---the UV index

-WHEN I view the UV index is shows color that gives conditions (favorable, moderate, severe)

-WHEN I view future weather conditions I see 
---5-day forecast with date
---weather icon
---temperature
---humidity

-WHEN I click on a city in the search history, I am presented with that citys info.

-WHEN I open the weather dashboard, I am presented with the last searched city forecast
